# Cleanup Summary: Removed Accidental Local Development Files

## Date
2025-10-30

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Files
- **`.envrc`** - Local direnv configuration containing:
  - Local path reference: `SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE="$HOME/.sops/age/keys.txt"`
  - Should not be committed as it's user-specific

### 2. Added Files
- **`.envrc.example`** - Template file for developers to create their own `.envrc`
  - Contains commented examples
  - Safe to commit as it has no actual secrets

### 3. Modified Files

#### `.vscode/settings.json`
- Removed personal UI preference: `"workbench.activityBar.orientation": "vertical"`
- Kept all project-related settings (formatters, linters, etc.)

#### `.gitignore`
Enhanced to prevent future accidents:
- Added `.envrc` to ignore list
- Added `.env.*.local` pattern for environment variants
- Added common development files: `*.log`, `*.pid`, `*.seed`, `*.pid.lock`
- Added `Thumbs.db` for Windows
- Added organizational comments

## Files Reviewed and Kept

### `.sops.yaml`
- **Kept**: Contains age public key for SOPS encryption
- **Reason**: Intentionally committed for team infrastructure encryption
- **Safe**: Only contains public key, not private key

### `.vscode/` directory
- **Kept**: Project-level VS Code settings
- **Reason**: Intentionally shared for consistent development experience
- **Note**: Removed personal UI preference

### `.claude/` directory
- **Kept**: Claude AI assistant configuration
- **Reason**: Intentionally committed for team collaboration

### `.env` files in apps
- **Kept**: `apps/desktop/.env`, `apps/website/.env`, `apps/mobile/.env`
- **Reason**: These are template files with empty or placeholder values
- **Note**: No actual secrets present, just structure

### `keystore-debug.jks`
- **Kept**: Android debug keystore
- **Reason**: Standard for development, not used in production

## Security Scan Results

✅ No sensitive credentials found in committed files
✅ No API keys, tokens, or passwords exposed
✅ No actual secret values in .env files (only templates)
✅ Localhost references are configuration defaults (safe)

## Prevention Measures

The updated `.gitignore` now prevents:
- All `.env` variants including `.env.local`, `.env.*.local`
- The `.envrc` file
- Common temporary and log files
- Operating system specific files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)

## Recommendations for Developers

1. **Copy `.envrc.example` to `.envrc`** and adjust paths for your local environment
2. **Use `.env.local`** for local environment overrides (already gitignored)
3. **Never commit files with actual credentials** - use environment variables
4. **Review changes before committing** to ensure no local-only files are included
